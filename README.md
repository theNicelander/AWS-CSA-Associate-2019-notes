# 2019 AWS CSA - Associate notes
> These notes are incomplete. Please see learning path below for my recommended way to pass the exam. 

## My learning path
1. [**A Cloud Guru**](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate): This course did an ok job of covering the fundamentals, but I felt there was a lot missing. I wouldn't recommend just doing this course on it's own and expect to pass the exam. 
    * Have a look at the Whizlabs course. It looks better on the tin  
2. [**Whizlabs Practise exams**](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-associate/). These were invaluable in detecting areas where I was strong and where I needed to focus my learning. 
3. [**SkullTech's study notes**](https://github.com/SkullTech/aws-solutions-architect-associate-notes). These notes are great and the reason why I didn't carry on with my notes as his are fantastic. 

# Final score: 881 / 1000
